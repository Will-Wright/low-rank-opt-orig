Tasks:
    (1) make experiments run with new software, so MPC can verify
    (2) update userguide, e.g. add continuation
    (3) add continuation to tfocs_SCD()
    (4) add a few more experiments, and clean some of them up
    (5) make sure efficient nuclear norm solver is working (part of (1) also)


Experiments to add:

URGENT (for initial release) 

  - Analysis

  - TV

NOT URGENT (for later release)

  - Dantzig, as LP (do 3 methods of Dantzig: conic, LP, and analysis with W = I)

  - TV + Analysis

  - nuclear norm, w/ efficient version

  - block norms (e.g. l_infinity or l2 of rows )

  - Analysis (with Dantzig)

  - RPCA


Clean examples to add:
    - Dantzig
    - Nuclear norm, e.g. how to use the error function with tfocs_tuple
    - Analysis
for cleaning examples, I prefer to keep the cvx code in there because it makes
    it very clear what problem is being solved (but the user doesn't need cvx
    since the examples should be able to load problems from disk)

Stephen's notes:
to hide a toolbox, do this:


% -- for testing only --
% flag = 'enable';  % either 'disable' or 'enable'
% license('test','signal_toolbox',flag);
% license('test','wavelet_toolbox',flag );
% license('test','communication_toolbox', flag ); % (awgn)
% license('test','image_toolbox',flag ); % (imshow, dct2)
